This is all of the design files and the code needed for my precision current source. The code for the microcontroller was made using the Arduino framework and PlatformIO so it's easy to modify and can be re-flashed with another Arduino, or over the USB interface once the bootloader is burned. The serial interface features a few basic commands for setting the current and reading it back using the onboard ADC. This design uses an external voltage source up to 120 volts, so it can be used with high resistance loads.
